## How to play

To play the game just click on the cards to uncover the back of the cards. If the two cards selected match, they will remain flipped until the player wins or the game is reset. Else if the two selected cards _do not_ match, they will flip back over to the original color and stop showing the image.

In the score panel you will find a move counter, the number of stars that the player has gotten and a timer. The move counter is going to display the number of clicks the player has made to flip the cards. The stars are going to decrease according to the number of moves. The first star is going to disappear at 26 moves and the second at 32 moves. And the timer is going to start once the player clicks the first card to play the game.

To reset the game just click on the repeat button to the right of the score panel or you can click on the restart button that appears in the modal when you have matched all the cards.
